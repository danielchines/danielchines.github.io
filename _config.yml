# About section
about:
  p1: I'm Daniel Hines, a CS student at Vanderbilt and avid iOS developer.
  p2: I originally used <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this tutorial</a> to create a blog-based site using Github's free .io domain. It looked pretty brutal, so I found <a href="https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme">this example</a> to implement the Freelancer Bootstrap theme and added my own HTML/CSS/Javascript to make it look pretty. The source code is all in my <a href="https://github.com/danielchines/danielchines.github.io">repository</a> on my Github page.  
  p3: Right now I'm most interested in Web and Mobile App Development, specifically for iOS. I designed, developed and published a simple puzzle game called The Next Level two summers ago. I'm also a Co-Founder at <a href="https://backme.com">BackMe Inc.</a>, a productivity-based app for iOS. I'm currently developing the front-end UI for version 1.0 of the app which will be available in late June.
  p4: Scroll down to view my past projects, which will be updated from my <a href="https://github.com/danielchines">Github</a> account. In the future I plan on delving into Ruby on Rails as well as Virtual Reality.
